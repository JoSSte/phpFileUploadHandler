        <p>This is a simple form upload tester, meant to try to both break the functionality and to improve my file
            upload handler. Not even an <code>accept="image/*"</code> on the <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> element</p>
        <h2>Environment</h2>
        <p>Since any client-side validation is easily circumvented, there is none in this page.</p>
        <p>The upload handler is set up to first check that the standard php file upload criteria are met, and then goes
            on to validate that the upload file is an image and can be saved.</p>
        <h2>Inspiration</h2>
        <p>I realized that my handler was vulnerable after completing <a
                href="https://tryhackme.com/room/uploadvulns">the upload vulnerabilities room in tryhackme</a> since I
            originally only checked the extension and the mime type.</p>
